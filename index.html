    The MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, is a cohesive set of
     technologies used for building efficient and scalable web applications.<br>

Its popularity stems from the seamless integration of each component: MongoDB's 
flexible data handling, Express.js's efficient server-side networking, React's<br>
 dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js's powerful back-end runtime environment.
